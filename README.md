A short overview of the HIEvPy library, including installation instructions, is given below. Full 
documentation, with examples, can be found on the project's [documentation pages](https://gdevine.github.io/hievpy).


#### Overview
HIEvPy is a python 3 wrapper around the API interface of the [HIEv](https://hiev.westernsydney.edu.au), a data capture 
application used by the [Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie) at [Western 
Sydney University](https://westernsydney.edu.au). 


#### Pre-requisites
To use HIEvPY you must have an active account (and subsequently a HIEv API token) on the 
[**HIEv**](https://hiev.westernsydney.edu.au) application. To discuss registration please contact HIE's data manager, 
[Gerry Devine](mailto:g.devine@westernsydney.edu.au)


#### Installation
HIEvPy can be installed via *pip*:

``` bash
$ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ hievpy
```

> Note: HIEvPy is currently hosted on Test PyPi. This will soon be moved to the official PyPi repository

Once HIEvPy has been installed, you can import it into a python console or script using:

``` python
import hievpy as hp
```
(using the optional *as hp* as a shortcut)
